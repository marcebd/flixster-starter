### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The lab sessions provided a foundational understanding, but they were not comprehensive enough for me to feel fully prepared for the assignment. Specifically, I struggled with implementing certain features using React, as the labs did not delve deeply into React's unique methodologies. For instance, managing state and props effectively was challenging, and I found myself needing to conduct additional research to bridge these knowledge gaps.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

With more time, I would have enhanced the user interface by adding a sidebar for better navigation. Additionally, I planned to implement a default image placeholder for movies lacking posters, and perhaps include a humorous YouTube video as an alternative when trailers were unavailable. These features would have improved the user experience by providing continuity and engaging content even when certain data elements were missing.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo went relatively well; I was able to demonstrate the core functionalities despite some features not being fully polished. For example, the filters for favorite and watched movies did not operate smoothly during the demo, but I managed to show their functionality by reloading the page. One improvement I observed from my peers was the use of preset images for missing movie posters. This is a clever way to maintain visual consistency and something I would like to incorporate in future projects.
